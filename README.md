# Maze-game-with-asm

Project = Create a maze game program in assembly language with the following steps given below: \
• First you need to draw the maze as given: \
INIT DB 0000000B, 0000000B, 0000000B, 0000000B, 0000000B, \
1110111B, 1000001B, 1111001B, 1111011B, 1000001B, 1011111B, \
1011111B, 1010001B, 1010101B, 1000101B, 1111101B, 1000101B, \
1010001B, 1010101B, 1010101B, 1100011B, 1000001B, 1011101B, \
1011101B, 1011101B, 1001001B, 1000101B, 1011101B, 1100001B, \
1101111B, 1000001B, 1010101B, 1010101B, 1010101B, 1111101b, \
0000000B, 0000000B, 0000000B, 0000000B, 0000000B 

• A dot must begin from a starting point and it can move by keyboard instructions \
• The dot moves constrained by following rules: \
o The dot can move upwards, downwards, left, and right by corresponding keyboard keys. For instance, if user presses the up key (↑), the dot must move upwards. \
o The dot can move only on unswitched leds. \
o If the dot encounters with an obstacle, it cannot pass. \
o The dot cannot exceed the borders of the dot matrix display output. \
• Demo of your project is given in the attachment. The dot must be able to pass through the maze as in the demo.
